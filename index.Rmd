## Introduction

This is a short demo of proof-of-concept of creating completely standalone HTML file using slidify with embedded rCharts. To help me test it, please do the following

1. Download the source of this page and save as HTML
2. Turn of wi-fi 
3. Refresh your browser page to make sure that there is no caching
4. Check to see if the presentation still works. 

Everything except fonts should work, since they have been embedded as data-URIs.

## Chart

```{r results = 'asis', comment = NA}
library(rCharts)
n1 <- nPlot(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars, type = 'scatterChart')
n1$show('inline')
```
